# Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction for the LLM Summarizer plugin.

---

## Current Focus

### PDF Text Extraction (In Progress)

We are actively working on built-in full-text extraction from PDF documents. This will allow direct summarisation of PDF content without requiring separate note preparation.

**Current workaround:** Use the [zotero-ocr](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr) plugin to extract text from PDFs into notes, which can then be summarised.

## Under Consideration

### Advanced Summarisation Modes

We are exploring additional summarisation approaches beyond the current individual and digest modes:

- **Comparative Analysis** — Generate summaries that explicitly compare and contrast multiple papers
- **Literature Review Synthesis** — Combine sources into flowing academic prose suitable for thesis chapters
- **Thematic Analysis** — Identify and organise common themes across a corpus
- **Research Gap Analysis** — Systematically identify under-explored areas in the literature

These features are being evaluated for feasibility, user demand, and implementation complexity.

### Enhanced Text Extraction

Beyond PDF extraction, we are considering:

- Direct extraction from EPUB and HTML attachments
- Improved handling of tables and figures
- Citation extraction and cross-referencing
